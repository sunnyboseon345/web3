  <h2>CHAPTER-2</h2>

<p>after I retierd my job, I got surgery and I stared learning English during heal time.
I had a passion for leanrning English, It was so much fun.
I joined a university few months later after retire. Everyting was new for me. I was always surrounded by lots of people but only players as me. I got bunch of good class mates who are from different background, especially the most memorabal thing is that I went to Malaysia for exchaning culture and languege for a month. It was my first time to have international friends even though my English was totally broken, all of them were sweet, and always joyful to hang out with.
thanks to them, I exprieced culture difference in person (in a good way), that time motivated me to keeo leanrning Languege, culters throughout traveing.</p>
