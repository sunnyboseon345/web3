  <h2>who am I</h2>
<p>This is SUNNY. I am from Korea, I was born in 1994.
I used to play volleyball over ten years since I was ten and I played in one of professional Women's volleybal teams in Korea for two years.<br>
I was pretty good at studying, I was a kid who is populer among friends all the time, and good at studying even sports. No kidding haha.
I technically stopped studying at school due to athletic training system in my country.
we did't really need to go to class to take it. we barely went to calsses when it's exam period.<br>
But I truly enjoyed and loved playing volleyball professionally, I had a dream to be a professional player in pro-League.<br>
guess what?! I made it.</P><p>when I was 18, I joined a team in professional league that I thought I was succeed. unfortunaley, It wasn't.<br> the time I was in the team for two years, was the darknest time ever in my life. I cried every single day. I was young and mentally super weak, I even got injured my shoulder.<br> I decided to retire playing voleeyball for the next chapter of my life.</p>
